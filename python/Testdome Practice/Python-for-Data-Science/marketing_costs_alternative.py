    """
    A class to predict required marketing expenditure using Theil-Sen regression.

    Idea came from: https://gist.github.com/mfakbar/f97949299171c75e868a37f3f578fa54

    I looked for alternative solutions after dealing with the floating point errors.

    Theil-Sen regression can throw exceptions when there is insufficient data and I think this is a
    potential reason why exceptions are thrown during TestDome testing.
